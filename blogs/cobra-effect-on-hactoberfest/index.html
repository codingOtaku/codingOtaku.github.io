          Hacktoberfest
        </a>
        is an annual event that occurs every October held by Digital Ocean.
        The event encourages developers to submit Pull Requests to Open Source repositories and as a reward
        you
        earn
        a limited-edition T-shirt.<br>
        Developers must contribute to a minimum of 4 repositories, But there is no upper limit set by
        Digital
        Ocean,
        this is where they went wrong.<br><br>
        Even though Digital Ocean has set up some
        <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality">
          "Quality standards"</a>, it wasn't enough for stop the
        <a href="https://nitter.net/shitoberfest/status/1311646233128181760" target="_blank">spam flood</a>.
        <br><br>
        <br>
        <h1 class="title has-text-white">What went wrong?</h1>
        Right now it is a blame game, The tweets says it all began because of a YouTuber demonstrated how to
        do
        a
        PR, but he failed at doing a quality contribution.<br>
        But, This has happened in the past — every year around the same time (October) — GitHub gets flooded
        with
        spam PRs, and this was the reason Digital Ocean updated their rules for contribution.<br>
        <br>
        In the first glance, it seems that the YouTuber is at fault, Most of the PR Spam looks a lot like
        what
        he
        demonstrated. <i>(I am not linking the YouTube video here, it might get deleted by the time you read
          this
          article)</i><br><br>
        Searching GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22Amazing+Project%22&type=issues"
          target="_blank">"Amazing Project"</a>
        or <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22Improve+Docs%22&type=issues">"Improve
          Docs"</a>
        (PR changes he demonstrated in his video) is being widely used for the PR spam!
        — here is an <a href="https://github.com/pinax/symposion/pull/189/files" target="_blank">example</a>.
        <br><br>
        But is he the only one responsible? No, the issue began with Digital Ocean Not being clear on what
        needs
        to
        be done to qualify.<br>
        Providing T-Shirts for PRs was not a good idea to begin with as it just screams the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect" target="_blank"><b>Cobra
            Effect</b></a> at their face!
        <br>
        The current implementation by Digital Ocean to fight spam is by labeling PRs with "invalid" or
        "Spam".<br>
        <b>Which means, the people who never heard of this event will not be able to report this unless they
          go
          to
          Digital
          Ocean's post on figting spam and understand what's to be done.</b><br>
        They also mentioned that they validate all PRs later in the event but that won't stop anyone.
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="title has-text-white">Anyone can whine, what's your solution?</h1>
        Before I get to my solution, see what GitHub proposed due to PR spam.<br>
        <div class="notification">
          Need to take a break, or limit which people can send a pull request to your repo?<br><br>
          You can now limit interactions for a period of time. Find it in your project settings ›
          moderation
          settings › interaction limits. <a href="https://t.co/ZCvQqBczVY" class="has-text-danger"

        Very Microsoft-y way of tackling problems ;)<br>
        <br>
        ...Okay, I'll stop.<br><br>
        Here what can be done.<br>
        Digital Ocean could stop current way of Hacktoberfest. But instead they can do a proper hackathon
        which
        promotes free and open-source software.<br>
        Let the developers improve on some existing repositories or create one of their own on platform of
        their
        choice. But set a limiter on how many repositories are considered. (Right now There is no upper
        limit)<br><br>
        Reward based on Quality of commits instead of quantity.<br>
        Labeling hactoberfest and mentioning DigitalOcean might help spread word about the hackathon, but it
        will
        eventually become a spam.<br>
        Instead, let developers submit link to the contributed repositories and usernames of developers
        to validate commits. If anyone starts spamming with meaningless commits, disqualify them
        immediately.<br><br>
        Will this stop the PR spam? Yes, to an extent. But the internet will never run out of spammers.
