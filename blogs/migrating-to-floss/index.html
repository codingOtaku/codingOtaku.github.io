            Please do note that just migrating to the alternatives mentioned in this
            list is not enough for user privacy.<br>
            For example just installing the operating systems mentioned here will not save you from the privacy
            exploits of the software you choose to install in it.<br>
            Be cautious of what you do, always make sure that there are no binary blobs in anything that you use.
            Get rid of things that automatically opts you into their telemetry services.

          malwares in your life.

          I have tried to list out every alternatives that I am using. And some of the softwares might not be
          maintained by the time you read this.<br>
          If they are outdated I recommend you to find alternatives from <a href="https://privacytools.io"

          There’s a big difference between
          <span class="tag is-success">privacy</span> and
          <span class="tag is-danger">security</span>,
          In a nutshell security is confidentiality of your data, while
          privacy is appropriate use of your data.<br>
          Of course, without confidentiality (encryption), your data can be intercepted and used inappropriately, so
          entirely unencrypted transmissions are always susceptible to privacy violations.<br>
          But just encrypting your data is not sufficient for your privacy, a weak encryption or a backdoor will
          provide you a false sense of privacy and security. This is why you should always choose apps and services
          which you can read the source code and lets you modify them.<br><br>
          <div class="box notification is-primary">
            <strong>The best way to enforce privacy is to collect no data at all.</strong>

                      But don't worry, There are other operating systems which exists which is free and much better.
                      One alternative
                      is GNU/Linux and this is the only Operating system I know which cares about user freedom.<br>
                      You can get a list of GNU/Linux Operating systems from
                      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html" target="_blank">gnu.org</a>.

                      is a fully free GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian and will probably suit your needs.

                      <i>Personally I feel debian can be used as long as you don't install anything

                      But what if you just came from Windows or Mac and you want the OS to "Just Work" and install
                      whatever you want?
                      There are other GNU/Linux operating systems exists which are

                      These non-free distributions came with the cost of your freedom, but much less compared to the
                      other two
                      mainstream desktop
                      operating systems.

                      I Do not recommend anyone to use Apple products if you wish to have a private

                      They

                        F-Droid</a> Repository is an easily-installable catalogue of free and open source apps
                      for Android. With F-Droid, it's easy to browse and install apps on your device, and keep
                      track of updates. You can also browse the repository with a web browser, and download the
                      app directly from there, if you can’t or don’t want to run the F-Droid client on your
                      device.<br><br>

                        All applications in the default F-Droid repository must be Free and Open Source software – for
                        example, released under a GPL or Apache license. Every effort is made to verify that
                        this is actually the case, both by visual inspection of the source, and by building the
                        application from the published source.

                      Software that reports user activity without permission (e.g. via Google Analytics) or tracks
                      user behavior (e.g. most advertising platforms) is specifically excluded from F-Droid’s own
                      repository, as is software with the primary purpose of interacting with a non-Free network
                      service. You are, of course, free to set up your own repository for this kind of software –
                      the server source is available, and the client will allow addition or removal of
                      repositories as you see fit.

                      I did not add Chromium and other browsers based on it in this list purposefully. It has some

                        onto iPhone users</a>, Apples policy does
                      not allow developers to develop a browser that is not based on their tool (Another reason to
                      stay away from Apple).
                      <br><br>
                      While
                      <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/" target="_blank">
                        Firefox
                      </a> source code from the Mozilla project is free
                      software, they distribute and recommend nonfree software as plug-ins and addons. Also their
                      trademark license imposes requirements for the distribution of modified versions that make
                      it inconvenient to exercise freedom 3.<br><br>

                        Fennec F-Droid
                      </a> is based on the latest Firefox
                      release. It's focused on removing any
                      proprietary bits found in official Mozilla's builds. There might still be some binaries left
                      and the app (or some builds) might get removed or re-pushed anytime.<br><br>
                      But Fennec is also not fully Free-- it is just a variant of firefox without the binary
                      blobs.
                      This is the reason why
                      <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.gnu.icecat/" target="_blank">
                        IceCatMobile
                      </a> was developed.
                      IceCatMobile is a Browser using the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which
                      implements current and anticipated web standards. This is a free software rebranding of the
                      latest Firefox-ESR release.

                      Another option is the Tor Browser, though it is

                    <section class="section">
                      <strong>Communication must not be done in a walled garden</strong>, using protocols instead of
                      apps makes sure that
                      you can
                      talk to anyone regardless of the app they use. This is the main reason I ask people to switch to
                      <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>.<br>
                      Element works with all Matrix-based apps and bridges into proprietary messengers too. <br><br>

                      Signal is another candidate, but I am adding it here half-heartedly. Unlike Element, using it with
                      other apps
                      will be a hassle right now and
                      requires you to use your phone number to create an account. Signal app does not exist in f-droid
                      and the
                      developer has been hesitant to do so for many years (here is one <a
                        href="https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/t/how-to-get-signal-apks-outside-of-the-google-play-store/808/20">instance</a>).<br>
                      The Signal clients and server does support federation, it is just a matter of time before it
                      becomes fully
                      federated. It is said to get a phone number free feature in the future and until then
                      theoretically one could
                      use a burner number for it.<br><br>

                      Telegram also raise some concerns as the chat is not default end-to-end encrypted and requires you
                      to identify
                      yourself with your number.
                      The encryption is done on the server side with their own solution. User will have to just "Trust"
                      the maintainers,
                      so I
                      recommend you to use Telegram only if you need to part of a public channel - not for secure
                      messaging.<br><br>

                      But these are much better in terms of privacy and security compared to the mainstream
                      applications.<br><br>
                      There is a widespread misconception that WhatsApp is secure and privacy-friendly.
                      While WhatsApp can’t see what’s inside the messages, they can see your activities, who is
                      sending a message to
                      whom and when - which is a large risk (read more on their policies from the links
                      below).<br><br>
                      And according to the WhatsApp <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/?_fb_noscript=1"
                        target="_blank">privacy
                        policy</a>, <strong>the company reserves the

                        requests.</strong>
                      If you use their service, please check their statements regularly.<br>
                      They also design the privacy policy page in a way that it is hard to point to a section of their
                      statement through links.<br>
                      Details on information shared to law enforcement can be found at <a

                      Facebook Messenger is even cruel in terms of privacy, I could not find a privacy policy for
                      their messenger app, the best I could find is <a href="https://www.messenger.com/privacy"
                        target="_blank">this</a>.
                      I will just assume that it has the same <a href="https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy"
                        target="_blank">policies</a> as
