            Switching to <a href="https://signal.org/" target="_blank">Signal</a> is a good step towards the right
            direction, but it is not enough.<br>
            We are seeing a massive spike in Signal
            <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/what-is-signal-why-is-it-trending-is-it-better-than-whatsapp/ar-BB1cCxgK"
              target="_blank">installations</a> since WhatsApp introduced their new privacy policy.<br>

            Though there are many other alternatives available, Signal is getting popular, but the hype is due to A
            celebrity's tweet to "Install Signal".
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike WhatsApp, Signal is a non-profit organization, and Signal is a free and open-source client.
            This makes Signal superior in terms of security as they have gone through multiple audits and anyone can
            verify that the encryption is done correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are things in common for both of them, some are good and some are... not so much.
          <details>
            <summary class="text-danger">Both are centralized</summary>
            <p>
              If Signal goes the wrong way, we cannot just switch a server and continue like what we can do with other
              decentralized, federated services like Mastodon, PeerTube, or Matrix.</p>
            <p>
              A wide adoption to a centralized service is never a good idea as moving from it means you have to convince
              everyone else using that service to move with you (isn't this what's happening with WhatsApp?).
            </p>
            <p>
              But if the service is decentralized, one can just switch from the server they don't like, it's like
              switching the e-mail, you'll just change the domain, and everyone can still mail you without installing
              another app or using a new different service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Edit:</b> on 15th January 2020, Signal had a global <a
                href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/01/15/so-many-people-are-using-signal-it-caused-an-outage/"
                target="_blank">outage</a> due to the surge in its usage, this also demonstate how vulnerable Signal is
              to a takedown.
              If a decentralized service had a similar issue, users could have moved on to another server without
              loosing functionality.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary class="text-danger">Both are not available on F-Droid or other Foss stores</summary>
            <p>
              WhatsApp does not qualify the requirements to be included in the F-Droid store, this is because WhatsApp
              is a proprietary application and has non-free binaries included in it.</p>
            <p>
              But Signal does qualify (or it used to until Signal devs decided to included Google reCAPTCHA)
              and the developer Moxie is against having Signal published in F-Droid.</p>
            <p>
              Instead, He decided to provide a link on the website to download the android APK directly.
              The link is not mentioned anywhere on the website, instead if you search for "Signal APK" in your search
              engine, you will be able to find the link to download the file.<br>
              But the page will warn you and try it's best to install the app from the privacy invading Google
              Play Store.
            </p>
            <p>
              F-Droid allows anyone to create custom repositories and that would be a much secure way to download the
              application than a direct link.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary class="text-success">Both uses Signal protocol</summary>
            <p>Signal protocol is one of the most secure cryptographic protocol that can be used to provide end-to-end
              encryption for voice, video and text conversations.<br>
              WhatsApp claims to use Signal protocol, but by design (proprietary service) there is a way for the user to
              verify if WhatsApp actually uses it or not.
            </p>
          </details>
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of relying on applications, one should rely on protocols, this makes sure that anyone can use the
            app of their choice to contact you.<br>
            Here are the list of protocols and platforms, The apps mentioned are available on <a
              href="https://f-droid.org" target="_blank">F-Droid</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of these platforms are also accessible through web browsers.
