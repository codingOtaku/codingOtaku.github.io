        This website does not have analytics.
        Yes, they are hosted using GitHub pages (at the time of writing) and it captures vague traffic details for
        insights, but I am not talking about that. I don't check those anyway...<br>
        <br>
        My reason to not use analytics was not for technical or moral reasons. There are analytics available right
        now that captures details in truly anonymous way and I chose to not use those either.<br>
        <br>
        <div class="notification">
          <ul>
            <li>
              If I had few readers, it would discourage me and I would find it difficult to continue writing.
            </li>
            <li>If some of my posts gets more attention, I will probably start writing things similar to those
              posts.</li>
            <li>If I had many readers who spend time on my blogs then I would potentially think that I am some
              kind of celebrity who is followed by many, which I am obviously not.</li>
          </ul>
        </div><br>

        There are other moral reasons for me to include them, but the above list came up first to me and the choice
        was
        obvious.
